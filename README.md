This is my solution of the "Hurricane Analysis" Project in Code Academy's Data Scientist: Machine Learning course.

Here's some toughts about my code :
  Exercice 1 : function "update_damages"
    This function could have read the value of each string and append only the part with number
    after a quick multiplication by the conversion factor and a cast in float to a new list.

  Exercice 3 : function "organize_year"
    This function will not consider more than one hurricane/year... I should have verify the existence of the year in the dictionary before updating it.
